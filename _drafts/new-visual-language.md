Process:
-Do whatever you want and don't follow anyone else's process verbatim because you need to find your own. There's no right way.

I'm a new designer, so I hesitate to have hard opinions about anything design related (or at the very least keep them to myself.) I'm constantly worried that there are better ways of doing things than I am aware of and I don't want to seem like an idiot. But it's a very vague and mysterious process, creativity and design, that is. For example, before writing this post, I googled "creating a visual language" to find articles that might tell me I'm wrong. What I realized that it's just other average people giving each other subjective advice.

Good design/creativity/music/art/inspiration/anything is borrowing from someone in some way shape or form. It is necessary. Nothing comes from nothing. Even if you think you aren't, you're stealing from the inspiration that has gone inside of you sometime in your life. Creativity is finding the best and most respectful way to do this.

Start out abstract, collecting visual things that catch your eye. Make lists of non-visual things that make up your persona. Just start making things, not worrying if they will be in the final version because you can make infinite versions down the road.

My job involves equal parts design and code. It's not that I enjoy one more than the other, but find the design process harder to get into mentally. Whereas with coding, I just open up Atom and get going. I don't fear getting stuck like I do when I code, because there is a definite solution to be find somewhere. It's less open ended.

Collected everything visual that I could. Went through my past pinterest boards and added new things to them. Photography books. Twitter. Used social media for the good. Then doodled everything that interested me into my own terms. Just a mess of a collage that made no sense. Tested out color schemes with Adobe Color and Typography with Google Fonts and Illustrator. Embrace the research process before jumping in. Doing my best to follow this quote even though I usually hop into code to avoid the painful unknown part of the beginning of designing something. "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." - John Johnson
