Welcome to my blog. Here I will post things that are from me. This includes personal and professional photos, rambling thoughts, lists, music I like, favorite things, projects I’m working on, sketches, ideas, and updates on my life. I am a photographer, but I promise it won’t all be photos of random people fake laughing and strangers getting married. That stuff’s great and I love what I do, but I do lots of other things as well! Who knows what this blog will hold for me and my journey with the Internet.

Here is a .jpg image of owner, Bailey Miller for visual support and reference:

To get things rolling I’ll tell you where I am in life at this very moment. After waking up from a stress induced 2 1/2 hour Sunday nap, I am currently boiling organic mac and cheese. It is November 8, 2015 and a frigid 39 degrees where I am.

Here are a few more quick facts about Bailey Miller:

1. Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked Ice Cream is everything to me
2. I play violin and I just started taking harp lessons, for which I am VERY excited
3. I photograph things
4. I am currently a senior in college, soon to be a real adult
5. I love watching squirrels do their thing
6. My favorite song of all time would have to be My Heart Will Go On
7. I love making things and doing arts and crafts. I’m an 80 year old woman at heart

This is crazy- my first real blog. Emphasis on the real because I had a Xanga in 4th grade and various Tumblr accounts where I primarily posted pictures of cats and other very strange things. But now this is for real. This blog is just as much for you as it is for me. I mean, it’s mostly for me because who knows if anyone will visit it. It’s a good place to figure out who I am and share my work in the process. Thanks for visiting, my friend.

Welcome to me.
