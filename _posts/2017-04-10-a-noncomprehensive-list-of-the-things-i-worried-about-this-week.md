A tick family living in my bathtub
My cat getting lead poisoning
Becoming radioactive
Lyme Disease
Bringing my ladder from outside and possibly scattering the harmful dust that came out of my ceiling when I hung a lamp one time
Breaking and entering
Being perceived as very annoying
Social media addiction
My happiness being a lie
A tick family crawling out of my ceiling
Having too many possessions
My violin possibly wanting to give up on me because I'm awful
My tap water being untrustworthy
Ibuprofen and Lexapro interacting
Swinging my towel across the ceiling and possibly scattering asbestos
Carcinogens
The vet telling my cat she needs to lose weight and having to put her on a diet forcing her to be less beautiful
Car accidents
My dishes not getting clean enough in the dishwasher
Someone filming me through my window to put on the Internet like something on Black Mirror
