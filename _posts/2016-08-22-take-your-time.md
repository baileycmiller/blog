It’s been a month and 10 days that I’ve been back home from mega-trip 2016. It’s strange to keep defining my life by the time since a trip, but that is the last logical landmark I’ve experienced, so alas. In this month and 10 days, I’ve been trying to get back into the groove of life and what that means for me in such a transitional season. When you’re living out of a suitcase, you quickly realize the aspects of life that you miss and the endeavors you need to spend your time pursuing. When I got back in my beloved bedroom full of all my wonderful musical instruments, books, craft supplies, cameras, classical composer busts, and mini cat figurines I was back in hobby heaven. All that time spent in awesome locations with limited resources left me oh so ready to dive head first into all of my passions once again. I found myself more ready than ever to learn, evolve, and create.

Here’s a list of all the things that have happened in my hobby-sphere in the past month and 10 days:

The day after I got back from Colorado, I drove to Bloomington, Indiana to purchase a harp.
I fell in love with this harp, so I started a YouTube channel for harp covers. So far my only post is a Rihanna song, but I hope to add more minor-keyed hip-hop songs very soon. Destiny child is up next.
I’ve done a lot of work amping up this website, adding more content, details, and photos in the galleries. I’ve also been learning some new web design techniques. You probably can’t tell much difference, but I recently completely gutted my CSS. I cleansed hundreds of lines of unused code and started using the pre-processor, Sass, to keep my code more organized.
I’ve submitted photography work to multiple galleries. I’m currently preparing for Summerfair Streetfair in Cincinnati this September, where I’ll have a booth with some prints.
I’ve been freelancing often, doing logo and web design, photography, and more recently, crafts.
I realized one of my passions is embroidering hip-hop lyrics onto fabric. I opened an Etsy shop and started selling some pieces at a super cool store in Middletown called Society.
I’ve been getting more serious about making my own music, which is always something I’ve dabbled in. I’ve just been playing around with Ableton Live again so we’ll see where it goes.
Upon realizing I cleansed out my accounts while traveling, I started pursuing as many strategies of making money online as I could find. This includes but is not limited to Ebay, Etsy, Upwork, 99Designs, UserTesting.com, focus groups, online surveys, Wonder, and multiple iPhone apps. I then realized that there is no good way to make money online.
I’ve learned the wonder that traveling can do for your inspiration, productivity, self-improvement, and general interest in life. I’ve been turbo-charged, running full force in every direction that peaks my interest this month and 10 days. But I’ve learned the hard way that sometimes I need to slow it down. When I want something very badly, I lose a handle on my patience. I go 0 to 100 real quick. In the heat of the moment I am blind to the fact that I can not learn a violin concerto or new programming language or *insert difficult but intriguing skill here* in a day. It’s just not possible and it’s not a good way to learn. Too often I set goals too high and beat myself up when I fall short.

There is a quality about me that I simultaneously am grateful for and fear above all else. It’s the desire to be good. My self esteem depends too heavily on my successes and I am devastated by my failure. I need to learn how to get the small things done before tackling the big things, all at once. Practice my scales. Have patience.

I need a masters in psychology to understand the minefield of my brain. I need to set real goals. I set goals alright, but I break them and make them too high and get frustrated if I can’t become a master in a day. But people say it takes 10,000 hours to become a master. If you break that down into an hour of practice a day, that makes 27 years.

I think a lot of creative people have this war with themselves. It hinders productivity, confidence, and self esteem. It doesn’t have to be this way. If I can learn to learn correctly and have constructive, healthy conversations with myself while I’m practicing and growing, it would make a world’s difference. Mental strength can cure a multitude of ills. Learning how to do this is the foundation of success and mental stability in creative fields. I write this with the hope that I will follow my own advice. So for goodness sake, take your time, sister. Enjoy the learning process. Know that it could take 27+ years for you to become a master. And that you can’t get anywhere with talent alone because you also need hard work. Set reachable goals for yourself and recognize your feats no matter how small. If you keep practicing, putting that time in day by day and never giving up, you’ll get somewhere.
