_Preface: I am always torn between wanting to engage in the beauty of online community and wanting to live an off the grid lifestyle without technology that Ron Swanson would condone. Half of me feels uncomfortable sharing personal information via the Internet, but the other half feels the need to turn experience into something tangible instead of letting it cloud my brain. With that said, here is my attempt at being uncomfortably personal in an effort to log my life experiences! Woo!_

2015 was a strange year.

A few days ago when I experienced the annual wave of inspiration to reset my life for the New Year, I sat down and wrote a list of 20 or so things that went a little like this:

1. Eat more fruits and vegetables
2. TRY to make fitness a habit even though it’s terrible
3. Obtain a cat (or 5)
4. Get a grown up job that I like (NOT one that makes me want to die on the inside)
5. Move to a new city and get my own place after graduation
6. Play music more
7. Be nicer
8. Love myself
9. Travel as much as possible
(etc, etc…)

The list went on and on. It was just your basic set of goals, nothing far from the usual. I let it build up as I contemplated new beginnings during solo car rides and long showers until I realized what I was doing. I was going to induce a minor panic attack within myself. The more I thought about all the things I could be doing better and all the ways 2015 had fallen short, the more anxious and uneasy I felt. This list kept getting bigger and bigger until I realized, I’m in no position to make resolutions right now.

I realized that my one and only resolution needs to be this: to make my mental health a priority.

I had enough thoughts, emotions, and anxieties in 2015 to fill 3-5 normal years. I’m emotion-ed out. If someone gives me any more emotions to feel or things to think about in the near future I will explode.  A lot of great things happened this year, but they were hard to see through the haze of everything else I felt. It was my worst year to date, and I’m very tired. I spent more than half of 2015 feeling like my heart and mind would burst. I felt hopeless. But I was somehow dragged out of 2015 alive, kicking and screaming. I must say, I have never felt more relieved to see a year go.

What am I left with? I have no energy left. I’m not sure what I’ve gained from this series of painful experiences. Right now it seems that I’m stuck in the middle, waiting to see if it’s going to get better or just continue getting worse. I haven’t had the epiphanies to sit here and write an inspiring post about all the lessons I’ve learned. To be honest, I’ve come out of 2015 with a lot less hope, joy, and love, and with a lot more fear, anger, and pessimism than I had when I came into it. I’m in no position to reflect upon life’s lessons with a clear head and I don’t know when I’ll ever get to that point.

All I know is that right now, I need to heal. No other resolutions. If gaining a sense of hope and mental stability means running 5 miles and eating 7 servings of vegetables a day, that’s awesome. If it means deviating from my goals, hobbies, and expectations, then so be it. What I have learned is that no one can save you but yourself. It sounds like a nice concept, but it’s actually terrifying. To know that I have the biggest control out of anyone on my own fate and well-being can either feel like the greatest blessing or the greatest curse, and lately it’s felt like the latter. However, one small part of me is starting to feel hope in such a phenomenon.

I still feel like my life is one big, pesky existential crisis, and I still feel abandoned and brokenhearted and sad oftentimes. The New Year (to the extent of my knowledge) did not change any of that. But here’s to hoping that relief will come in time. Maybe sometime soon my brain will become so fed up with being ill that it will launch me on my feet with such force that I won’t be able to fall again. Until that happens, I’m going to make it my mission to take whatever small steps I can to make my brain feel at home and loved.
