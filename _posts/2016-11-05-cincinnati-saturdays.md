Yo blog, I ain’t seen you in a minute.

A lot has changed in two months. Last time I was here, I was in the process of writing up a post about the adventures of being unemployed. I’m glad I never had to finish that one.

Before I get into what I really came here for, I’ll supply a brief update. On September 6, I started my first real full-time job as a UX Designer at Gaslight, a software development consultancy in Cincinnati, Ohio. Long story short: I love it, I’m extremely grateful for how everything turned out, and I couldn’t have found a better fit. After a long, discouraging bout with the job search process, I ended up with my first choice with unbelievable relief. You can read more about my employed adventures in my Gaslight blog post here. A month after I started, I moved to Cincinnati from Middletown, settling in the hood of Mount Adams. I can walk downtown to work, to Eden Park, and to the Art Museum from my place, and I’m developing solid calf and gluteal muscles from all of the incline hiking that living in this charming mountain neighborhood requires. Everything has fallen into place.

Overall, I’m tickled to say that adjusting to a full time work routine hasn’t been as rocky of a transition as I assumed. It helps that I was very, very ready to start working towards the end of my obligation-free summer. The weirdest part now is figuring out what my evenings and weekends aside from work look like. What am I supposed to do by myself in this new apartment when I’m not going to Home Depot or Target or working up a stress sweat from hanging a shelf on my hard-to-drill-through walls? I don’t have my course schedule to direct me on how to incorporate my interests into my life and personal work. No more orchestra concerts, quartet practices, photo critiques, or late nights in the darkroom. My extra-curricular passions operate on my own terms now. This is good and bad, I’m finding.

So what do I do? I love routine, and it helps occupy my mind. But I also need to lean against it, and find new ways to live in the day-to-day outside my comfort zone. It’s funny how much I take for granted now that I live here. Things that I used to take day trips to see, I now ignore because they’re at an arm’s reach. I have to force myself to step outside my front stairs and see my own city as a tourist like I used to. So that my mind will be stimulated, my sense of wonder enriched, and my youth preserved.

So basically, I need to keep walking. I came up with this idea: every Saturday (winter months, permitting), I will explore a new neighborhood in Cincinnati. Just walking, with my camera. Emphasis on the camera, because lately I’ve been developing an irrational fear of taking photos. That’s weird, you might say, because I identify as a photographer. I love it, but here’s a little secret: it scares me. This little anxiety makes me sad and makes me miss out on photo opportunities a more bold me might take. However, once I get in the groove of making photographs, I forget about it. The hard part is getting myself to that place.

I came up with this idea today while exploring one of my new favorite spots: Northside. It’s a shame I didn’t think of this idea last weekend when I took a 7 mile trek to Findlay Market and clear to Kentucky and back. My glutes felt that. Today I wandered around in observation, stopping to eat one of the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had at Sidewinder Coffee and finding the planner of my dreams at Shake It Records (an unlikely place to find a planner, which added to the enchantment). The neighborhood reminded me of a more diverse Yellowsprings and was a very pleasant place to walk and soak up the last of the Daylight Savings Time sun. I liked the unexpectedness of what you might see on the street. Northside isn’t as polished as other Cincinnati neighborhoods, but much more colorful and eclectic, making for many photos. After that I headed back to my own neighborhood for an afternoon walk to the Cincinnati Art Museum.

I can’t wait to keep walking. Before I walk, I always worry that the residents of the place will be able to point me out as an outsider. Or that they’ll look at me funny for seeing the potential in things that don’t seem worthy of photographing. I worry that my effort to get to this place will be for naught and I will just end up tired. But today was a very good day. I discovered treasures. I was present. And I was very glad I walked.
