_“If you talk enough sense then you’ll lose your mind”_
-Amber Run

Today was a beautiful warm May day. I spent it eating Chinese food, practicing harp, and taking 3 distinct naps. Yes, 3.

As usual, I am sitting in bed thinking deeply about my life and being way too existential for my own good. I’m thinking about the past few years and the future and the present all at the same time. Thinking about my own thinking. Thinking about feeling.

I don’t want to think about thinking anymore. I don’t want to be so hyper-aware of my feelings constantly. I just want to coast through time uninhabited. I don’t want to constantly analyze my moods and realize that I’m either happy or sad. I don’t want to know these things. I don’t want to worry about constantly being unsatisfied. Being human is a blessing and a curse. We are all too aware. We see the world not just for what it is, but beyond. We see the good and bad so much more strongly than the other species. Because we know too much about things we can not control.

Sometimes I don’t want to know. I think about thinking and feeling constantly. It leaves everything empty and foggy. It leaves me weak. I don’t want to question every little thing anymore. I am always wringing life out, trying to get more than it will give me.

I don’t know how to reveal my feelings without remorse. I do not want to tell you these things, but I feel like I need to. Every time I try to speak my words get stuck in my throat and I choke on them, turning red in the face.

All I want is to stand on my own without falling in the face of emptiness and negativity.

I want to feel in control of my feelings.

I want to be satisfied.

Without thinking so hard.
