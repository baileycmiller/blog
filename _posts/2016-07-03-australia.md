Australia, the land down under. The country of numerous dangerous and venomous creatures, kangaroos and koalas, beaches, the Outback, and accents.

After spending a VERY long time in planes and airports, I arrived in Melbourne, Victoria. The first day was full of great adventure and life-changing experiences (I fell asleep at 4pm). My first day in Australia taught me one thing and it is that jet lag is very real. Fourteen hours later, I woke up feeling guilty so I pushed myself out the door.

I soon discovered that Melbourne is the kind of city that if it weren’t a 24-hour plane journey from home, I would seriously consider living in. It’s extremely walkable, feels reasonably safe (compared to US cities), has plenty of art and culture, and is just generally pretty fun. Unique to Melbourne (unless they have them in other cities I haven’t visited), are the laneways that weave between the main streets. They’re used as hubs for street art, shops, and the restaurants that all the cool Australians seem to eat at (but I didn’t feel cool enough to eat alone at because I have an inferiority complex, so I stuck to less cool dining options).

I spent my time in Melbourne walking myself to exhaustion, but all for a good cause. Half of the time I wandered around, with no real destination in mind. I find that often the best treasures are found when you aren’t looking for them. Some of the highlights I saw of the city were the Queen Victoria Market, Royal Botanic Gardens, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Old Melbourne Goal, and the State Library of Victoria. But really, my favorite places were the ones that I stumbled upon randomly; the ones with no real names. Laneways, paths along the river, compositions in space, medians where street performers sang, posted up signs on building walls, slants of light along tree lines.

After I left Melbourne, I headed for JAPAN. That was a huge journey in and of itself, so I’ll save that for my next post and skip that part for now. Fast forward 10 days, and I was back in Australia, but this time in Gold Coast, Queensland. I stayed with my Australian family, who taught me all about their country on their yearly visits to the States growing up. I thought I was up to date on the Aussie lingo, but really nothing can prepare you for the vast amount of unique words and phrases that Australians have for things. My personal favorite: “Good on ya,” among others. I also wasn’t prepared for the weather, as I ignored all warnings to bring a good jacket for Australia’s “winter.” I laughed at those wearing winter coats in 60 degree weather, but deep inside I must admit that coatless Ohioan me was chilly.

When I was back in Australia, I wasn’t overly adventurous at first. Walking in Japan for a week and a half on top of the traveling I had done leading up to it left me extremely lethargic. I had spent one layover day before departing for Japan in Surfer’s Paradise, which is exactly what it sounds like. The sun was out and I walked along the beach, in awe of the waves and spotless shore. Australia’s coastline is known for it’s beauty and surf, and it definitely wasn’t a letdown. My favorite beach spot was Byron Bay, which is a neat little town right on the beach. There we hiked out to a lookout and lighthouse, spotting schools of dolphins and even whales.

After getting my depleted energy at least half back, I made it out to a rainforest in Springbrook. While it wasn’t the constant downpour that I imagined, it held some of the most beautiful nature sights I saw in Australia. While the country is too big to easily see icons like the Great Barrier Reef and the Outback all in one trip, I was satisfied enough to see some of the majestic parks and forests in the Gold Coast area. One of my main missions for Australia was to see a wild kangaroo and on the last day, after seeing dozens of domesticated ones at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, I finally saw some through the car window on the way home.

On the last night in Australia, I looked up into the clear night sky. The southern constellations were unfamiliar, like a new realm of space to discover. It was strange, knowing I’d be heading back to America, not knowing when I would again be in a foreign land such as this. Traveling, something that is usually a temporary novelty, was starting to feel like the norm. I knew things would feel different back in my home country. Things would be more routine, although with plenty to discover yet.

It’s a weird feeling being somewhere, knowing you might never be back in that same place again. And If you happen to arrive again, things would not be the same. You would be different and your combinations of emotions and thoughts and circumstances would be different. It’s so hard to latch on to the meaning of passing moments. It seems like I can never get the full picture of a situation, a moment, or a place until I’ve grown past it. So much talk is about living in the moment, but what do I have to do, to live a speck in time to my fullest capacity? Do I close my eyes? Or yell into the air that I’m alive? I don’t know if any of us really know how to feel moments fully. Maybe the most we can do is live in awe as best we can, leaving the rest for the reflection of our memories.
