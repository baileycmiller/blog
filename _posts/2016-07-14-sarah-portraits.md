Every once and awhile, I like to post portraits that I’m really proud of. It’s summer now and the warm evening light is a gorgeous daily event; one that I’ve missed while not being able to embrace it as much while traveling. The other day I got to photograph my friend Sarah, and it was one of those perfect July nights.

Sometimes I feel like I’m not really cut out to be a portrait photographer. I’m not super outgoing, not good at coming up with the right words to say, not good at making babies smile, I embarrass myself under pressure, and the list goes on. But I forget that I really love taking portraits. Once I’m in the moment, my immense anxiety goes away and I can just make photographs and if I’m lucky, make art. Portrait and art photography are not entire different entities, as I sometimes blindly believe. They influence each other, as any part of you influences all that you do. Even when I’m working on personal work I find that I’m composing my frames like I would a portrait, but instead of working with flesh I’m trying to breathe life into objects. That is where I find that portrait and non-portrait photography intersect. And although I avoided portrait photography for a long time, whether due to anxiety, lack of subjects, introversion, mild anti-socialism, or laziness, I’ve found that it’s a very expressive genre that I love working in and can do. It’s an interesting dynamic, watching my portrait work interact with my personal work and vise versa. In photography, in talents, and in life, I think it’s important to keep every part of you active and alive, never cutting off anything that you’re passionate about. I think the intersections of these contrasting things speak to each other and grow deeper roots in all directions, and that can be inspiring.

Ramblings aside, here’s some of my favorite photos from Sarah’s portrait session.
