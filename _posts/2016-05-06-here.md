_“Is there no way out of the mind?”_
-Sylvia Plath

My photo book, Here, came in the mail and I’m pretty excited. It’s my first quasi-legitimate art photography book, aside from embarrassing high school scrapbooks. I’ve been working on gathering images for a few months now, making new images and tying them together with old photographs I’ve made in the last few years. By looking at all the images I’ve made since basically the beginning, it’s so interesting to see the patterns that arise. I’ve always been so fascinated with emptiness, and it’s funny to discover how I was drawn to the same themes that I am now so early on. From taking 35mm photographs when I was 14 of the local abandoned mall to still essentially being attracted to the same places and visual elements. I guess I’ve always been interested in finding the strange in the mundane. That’s what this book is about— the weird feelings of life, the thoughts that come with them, and the emptiness between—here.
