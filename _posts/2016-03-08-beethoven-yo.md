I’ve heard this quote multiple times, but tonight I heard it once more and thought to myself “Dang, Beethoven. Way to spit mad game.” Because this quote speaks so much truth. As a musician, most of my time is spent practicing technical details and skills, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But how often do I practice passion? When do I sit down and analyze what I want to express through my music and how I want the audience to feel? Not enough. Sure, notes, intonation, dynamics, articulation, and all the other musical elements that make it so moving are important. But without passion, there is nothing.

This is true not only in music, but in all facets of life. What I strive for at this moment is to pour passion into everything I do, whether it is music, art, design, relationships, health, self care, and so on. You have to nurture your passions in this life. Water the plants. Eventually all hobbies and pursuits will run dry if you don’t intentionally pour energy and hope into them. Relationships fall apart. You quit a hobby after years of pursuing it. You give up on your dreams. You settle. But you can’t expect everything to run on auto-pilot successfully. Passion doesn’t just fall like rain. It comes from within, and sometimes you have to create it. Breathe it out.
