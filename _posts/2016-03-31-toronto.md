Last week I left America for the first time to go to the majestic Toronto. It was a pretty interesting experience. My observations about Canada in my short time there were these:


1. They have beautiful money. Very fun
2. The speed limits are slow
3. The metric system is surprisingly difficult to put into practice
4. There are a LOT of Tim Horton’s
5. The walk signals are more peppy-looking
6. People do actually say ‘eh’
7. The squirrels are darker colored than where I live and very cute

Anyways, I like Canada. Except for the weather. I don’t believe I saw the sun a single time in the five days I was there. Even though that was a bummer and I didn’t see Drake running through the 6 (even though I did eat at his restaurant in the hopes that I would), it was pretty cool. I made a lil’ doodle map of my favorite places I explored.
